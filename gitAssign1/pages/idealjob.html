    <b>Pega BPM Lead Systems Architect </b>
    <br>
    <p align="justify">
      I came across an advertisement for the job position of “Pega BPM Lead Systems Architect”, and was very intrigued by what the position entailed. This seems to be a very demanding role, requiring a lot
      of experience in coding, IT systems architecture and ‘Dev Ops’, project management, security and business. It seems that a lead IT systems architect is a job that requires a vast knowledge of the
      intersections between many business and IT related fields, making this job equally daunting and enticing. As I love exploring the ‘inter-relationships of things’, this position speaks highly to my interests.
      The skills required to perform well in this role include:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Knowledge and experience with Scrum and Agile project management methodology</li>
      <li>Familiarity with Java, J2EE architecture, Extensible Markup Language (XML), JavaServer Pages (JSP), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)</li>
      <li>Familiarity with web languages including Javascript, CSS, HTML5, XML</li>
      <li>A clear understanding of business, corporate structure, the general and unique needs of the business, and an understanding of accounting to manage budget and scope</li>
      <li>A good knowledge of IT security, databases, legacy systems and web services</li>
      <li>A good knowledge of data structures</li>
    </ul>
    On top of this fairly overwhelming list, some qualifications and experience are required:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>A degree in software engineering, computer science or similar</li>
      <li>A Pega Certification</li>
      <li>Experience in systems architecture and project management</li>
      <li>Work experience as a PEGA Developer</li>
    </ul>
    All of this would be with the accompanying requirement of a few decades of work experience in information technology, or as a network administrator, systems or software engineer.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Currently, my experiences and knowledge pale in comparison to this list. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and an introductory knowledge to Python and programming principles. I have
      experience with small level project management, and believe I have strong communication and leadership skills. As it stands, there is a lot to be desired about my technical capabilities in IT, but I
      believe the pathway ahead to such a job position is quite clear. I’m currently enrolled in a Bachelor of IT through RMIT to develop a foundation of coding, and a broader understanding of IT fields and
      practices. After which I could start working in IT to gain experience. Right now I’m not entirely sure what work exactly that might be, but I imagine something in coding, maybe app development, systems
      administrating or cybersecurity. While working, I could study an MBA to better round out my knowledge of business and accounting, or a masters in Information Systems. If required, I could complement my
      learning with online project management courses (<a href="https://www.icollege.co/course-bundle/complete-project-and-quality-management-certification-prep-bundle" target="_blank">such as this online project
        management course.</a>)
