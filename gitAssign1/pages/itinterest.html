      <h2>My Interest In IT</h2>

        One of my favourite quotes from recent years is one from Westworld, where Anthony Hopkins’ character explains, <i>“Everything in this world is magic, except to the magician.”</i>
        I feel this quote is directly applicable to lay people across all industries. Having control over your home’s lights, windows, thermostat and security from a device in your pocket seems
        dumbfounding and fantastical to those who do not understand how technology interacts. To the unknowing, it seems to be just like magic. I am currently one of the unknowing lay people,
        and it is my goal to become enlightened on all things information technology. I’m fairly new to the field, but have a strong interest in broadening an understanding in all things coding
        and IT for a few reasons. I’m curious by nature, and want to better understand the increasingly digital or technological world that we find ourselves in. I want to explore the interrelationships
        between software and hardware, and the internet of things interconnectivity that pervades our modern lives. I would like to feel more cluey when it comes to cybersecurity, data and privacy concerns.
        I would like to be able to interact with the digital world on a deeper level. And, I like puzzle solving! So, my current interests in IT lie in coding and full stack development, cybersecurity and DevOps -
        Anything that requires a good understanding of many interrelated parts. I have had some experience with the basics of coding, I began self learning the basics of Python in 2019, and taught myself HTML and
        the basics of CSS for toying around with website design in highschool in the early noughties. I’ve since used this basic knowledge to tweak wordpress templates.<br>
        <br>
        A friend of mine founded an IT rollout company, and has been doing work with it all around the world. He is bright, dedicated, and very passionate about all things IT. He formalised his knowledge through
        a qualification with IT from RMIT university. The course seemed to be well regarded throughout the Australian IT communities, and seems to offer a strong introduction to a wide variety of IT fields.
        With a positive consensus, I decided to take the plunge and begin the IT journey through RMIT.
        <br><br>
        As it stands, I feel generally oblivious to the possibilities of work in IT. I don’t yet know what I don’t know, and so by studying I am hoping firstly to clarify my interest and direction through exposure
        to the various facets of IT that the RMIT Bachelor of IT course offers. Secondly, I am hoping to become an able programmer with a number of languages under my belt, as I feel that understanding coding will
        serve as an integral foundation to learning most other things in IT. Finally, I would like to understand more about cybersecurity, IT infrastructure and systems architecture. I think that I would find the
        problem solving involved in these areas deeply engaging.
