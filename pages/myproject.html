      <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
      <hr color="#881738">

    </center>
    <b>Overview:</b><br>
    <p align="justify">
      My aim is to design an app that assists self-learners of Auslan (Australian Sign Language) to be able to better interpret fingerspelling, using a 3D model, procedural animation,
      and user control over the speed and starting/stopping/repeating of the animation playback. While much of Auslan has moved away from fingerspelling, replacing strings of individual
      letters with other gestures to communicate words or phrases, these gestures are often interspersed with fingerspelling for common abbreviations, niche vernacular, or specifics
      (like names of people or companies etc). Sometimes to get a point across, it is entirely necessary to literally ‘spell it out’ for people. Currently, the resources available to
      assist with learning this part of the Auslan interpretation skill set are quite limited, and I believe that this app would be a welcome and disruptive contribution to the Auslan
      education space.</p>

    <b>Motivation:</b><br>
    <p align="justify">
      Auslan is a fantastic skill that many can benefit from. It is a somatic language that allows us to communicate with each other across visually instead of verbally. Of course, it
      allows us to communicate with people who are deaf or hard of hearing, but it also offers many other benefits. Babies can understand somatic gestures before they can verbalise their
      intentions - if you teach a baby the sign for ‘water’, they can knowingly request water with the sign long before they can request it with words. Having a somatic component to learning
      has been identified as a strong learning assist even for the hearing - by associating a gesture with letters or with words, students tend to remember the material better. Furthermore,
      how cool would it be to be able to order food or drinks from across a busy bar if you could catch the attention of the staff - or your mate at the bar - from your seat? You could
      communicate with others from a distance in noise restricted circumstances (across a quiet library for example).</p>

    <p align="justify">
      Auslan is just very cool. I believe more Australians should be encouraged to consider learning it, and the resources for practice and self-learning are clunky.
      There are obvious and elegant ways to develop good resources that are seemingly easy to achieve using today’s IT and design technology. I think it’s just about somebody
      sticking their hand up to do it for the betterment of the Deaf community, for assistance with learning, and for those simply interested in picking up a new skill or hobby.
    </p>
    <b>Description:</b><br>
    <p align="justify">
      When learning Auslan, learning to fingerspell is quite easy to do, and there are currently apps that will provide the hand postures and gestures for each letter in the English language.
      From there, it is easy to practice fingerspelling words to others. What is not easy to do by yourself however, is to practice being able to interpret fingerspelling from someone else.
      The goal of the app is to provide a resource that people can use to practice reading fingerspelling without the assistance of another person.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The current available methods of self-learning to interpret fingerspelling are limited or clunky, and I believe there is a far more dynamic and elegant solution waiting to happen.
      Currently, the means of practicing to learn fingerspelling are limited to these methods:
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
    <ol>
      <li>You can practice in the mirror, watching yourself.</li>
      <li>There are a few limited home-made resources on youtube and other video streaming services of people fingerspelling particular words or sentences.</li>
      <li>There are some apps which contain videos of an Auslan tutor fingerspelling certain words or phrases.</li>
    </ol>
    <p align="justify">
      The primary limitation of method one is - You already know the word that you are intending to fingerspell, and so even though you may be spending time looking at each gesture, because
      you have the knowledge of the word you’re intending to spell already, you lose the effectiveness of being able to quickly interpret the fingerspelling of an external source. When
      interpreting fingerspelling from somebody else, you do not necessarily understand their intended word until it is complete. By practicing in the mirror, you already understand the intended
      word before you begin. The effectiveness of learning is stifled.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The limitation in method two (streamed services) is where because the available resources are few, after you’ve gone through them once or twice, the words you would be intending to
      interpret are memorised and again, you’re no longer actively practicing interpreting, just practicing the memory of the video specifically. This is also clearly a limited means of learning.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The limitations in method 3 mirror those of the first two - The resources in the available Auslan learning apps show videos of a tutor gesturing and fingerspelling. This is great for learning
      things out of context (e.g. the individual words for things like “apple” or “car”) but it lacks practice videos for fingerspelling and again, an avid learner would be able to get through the
      fingerspelling resources quickly, and thus run out of learning materials quickly.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The real problem here is that the available external resources (ie; not doing it yourself in front of a mirror) are all videos of people. Thus, once you’ve seen it, you’ve seen it, you know
      it and you’re no longer interpreting it; you’re referring to your memory more than you’re referring to the external information (the person signing).
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      What if we created a dynamic 3D model person that could fluidly and accurately move from any fingerspelled letter to any fingerspelled letter in a dynamic and realistic way? What if we could
      then associate the English characters to the fingerspelling model, so that it would essentially read a string and output a procedural animation? It would remove the need of the constant production
      of new videos. We could give the app a backlog of books to fingerspell sentences from. We could give the user a slider to control the speed, and play, pause and repeat buttons to work with.
      There could even be a user text input which could be matched to the string to verify whether or not they got the answer right, or a way to show the associated string text on screen at the user’s
      discretion, for after they’ve attempted to interpret the fingerspelling.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Feeding the app volumes of text to interpret into fingerspelling would very quickly provide a user with countless hours of potentially randomised but relevant fingerspelling interpretation practice,
      and having speed sliders (and perhaps, ‘presets’ for difficulty) could really allow the user to push themselves or to develop their speed of their development in interpreting fingerspelling at a
      pace of their choosing. The user can personalise the difficulty to suit the ideal pace of their learning.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Once finished, the app would be put on the Google and Apple app stores. Once available, the information would be sent through to Deaf communities (such as
      <a href="https://accessplus.org.au" target="_blank">AccessPlus</a> or <a href="https://deafsociety.org.au/" target="_blank">The Deaf Society</a>), through
      to relevant Education Departments in Australia and New Zealand. We would use Facebook targeted ads to reach Australian and New Zealand deaf communities online
      to spread awareness of the product. The Developers team could present the app at conferences on Deaf Education (like <a href="https://iced2020.com/" )>ICED</a>).

    </p>

    <b>Software and Hardware Requirements for the Project:</b><br>
    <p align="justify">
    <ul>
      <li>Something to code on (laptop/desktop computer)</li>
      <li>Android and iOS devices for testing</li>
      <li>SDK for Android and iOS</li>
      <li>Unity game engine; it is crossplatform, and will be required to animate our model</li>
      <li>Depending on how hyperealistic we'd like our model to be, Zbrush could be required</li>
      <li>The Adobe Suite for graphical UI, GUI animations and sound effects. Even though hard of hearing people and deaf people will not benefit from sound effects, the app is
        intended for anyone who is interested in developing their Auslan skills. Sound effects are important cues in educational platforms</li>
      <li>Registry as an Apple Developer</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <b>Skills and Knowledge Required:</b><br>
    <p align="justify">
    <ul>
      <li>Coding skills in perhaps these languages: VS Code, Kotlin, Java, XML, Objective-C</li>
      <li>Skills in Auslan, with guidance from an Auslan Interpreter or native signer to confirm the accuracy of our animations. Ideally we would source the assistance of
        an Auslan instructor.</li>
      <li>Animation and design skills with Unity, and perhaps experience with 3D modelling, rigging and animation</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
