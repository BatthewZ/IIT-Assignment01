        Hello! My name is Ben. I’ve been a musician for a little over a decade, and have spent a lot of time performing, and in the last five years, composing and teaching.
        I’m a studied musician, I have an honours degree in jazz piano.  The musician’s life is one that is equally exciting and at times, debilitating, and while there is
        much to be passionate about within this field, there is also a lot left to be desired.  I’m now in my early 30’s, and am looking to begin a career change into IT.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        In order to better understand my chances of success in a career change, I have taken a number of personality and learning style tests.
        These tests have provided me with some insights that may be helpful for me to use in order to better optimise my career trajectory, and
        learning methods. Below is a brief summary of my findings for each, followed by my interpretation of their value going forward.

                  In brevity, INFJs are idealistic, deeply empathetic, and are attentive to personal and emotional concerns with all decision making. They are highly creative,
                  and coupled with their empathic tendencies, can become strong innovators, and compassionate educators. INFJs are driven by strong values, and seek out meaning
                  in all areas of their lives.</p>

                  <b>The Big Five Personality Test</b> | <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/21348076" target="_blank">Full Article Here</a>

                  <p align="justify">
                    According to these results, I am highly creative and enjoy thinking in abstract and complex ways with a strong interest in arts and culture; I have inclinations
                    toward enjoying attention awarded by others; I prefer to cooperate rather than compete with others, and have a mild tendency toward neuroticism.
                  </p>
                  <p align="justify">
                    In alignment with the Myers-Briggs personality type INFJ, the Big Five test describes my strongest Core Pattern as an “Empathic Idealist” - One who “uses insight
                    and creativity to help others, and someone who thinks about how the world could be a better and more beautiful place,” and suggests that I’ll be well suited to
                    innovative problem solving through complex analysis. However my weakest Core Pattern is the “Logical Mechanic”, describing someone who defers to proven methods, and
                    who seeks to ensure accuracy and efficiency in logical systems. This coupled with an average ‘Conscientiousness’ rating suggests that while I will be very helpful in
                    thinking outside the box, expressing myself and communicating with others, I may have a poor attention to detail with regards to optimisation.

              The results from this test encourage learning from others through spoken language - conversation, lectures, rather than from written instruction.
              The article recommends a study environment free from auditory distractions, and to reaffirm knowledge by repeating it through some aural means; speaking it aloud
              or creating a song around it.

          </center>
          <p align="justify">
            While taken perhaps with a grain of salt, I would do well to consider the benefits and concerns that the information from these tests provide in relation to work and study going forward, especially in regards to my role and functions in a
            team. The findings suggest that I will be able to navigate the social aspects of teamwork and communication quite naturally, and will be attentive to the thoughts and feelings of others with decision making. They suggest that I will be
            able to quickly provide ‘outside the box’ solutions, and that I’ll be able to quickly innovate on other people’s ideas. This may mean that I will be able to come up with novel ideas to problems or roadblocks. However, they also show that
            I will default to looking for a complex and out of the box solution when a simple and direct solution may be all that is required, thus making my approach interesting, but inefficient. The findings suggest that I may also lack a certain
            level of attention to detail. I may over-complicate ideas because complexity and exploration beyond what is required may be engaging to me.
